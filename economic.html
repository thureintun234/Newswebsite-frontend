					That's the assessment widely shared by economists in light of the rising threats facing the U.S. economy, from a raging trade war to more cautious spending by consumers and businesses to a global slowdown. Their collective forecast is that last year's 2.9% growth - the fastest year of expansion since 2015 - will be followed by a more tepid 2.3% gain this year.

					That pace would roughly match the average annual growth since the current expansion began in 2009. In two months, it will become the longest post-recession recovery on record. But it has also been the slowest since World War II.

					The Trump administration, defying the assessments of mainstream economists, insists that its program of tax cuts, regulatory reform and tougher enforcement of trade deals will produce dramatically higher annual growth above 3% for the next six years.

					Here are three key reasons why economists think growth has peaked for the year:

			<img src="images/economic1.jpg" class="img-fluid my-3">
			<p class="my-4">
				<p class="text-justify">
					China’s newly announced sanctions against a principal American defense contractor may have been done more for political effect than economic punishment.

					On Tuesday, China said it would sanction Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.71%, which produces America’s top fighter planes, after the U.S. government approved a $620 million arms sale to Taiwan.

					“China firmly opposes U.S. arms sales to Taiwan,” Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said at a news conference on Tuesday. “In order to safeguard national interests, China has decided to undertake necessary measures and impose sanctions on the main contractor for this sale, Lockheed Martin.”

				<p class="text-justify">
					Income and wealth inequalities, including wide racial disparities, are keeping the U.S. economy from reaching its potential and pose ongoing “social risk,” according to a report from Moody’s Investors Service.

					The report notes that the median net worth of the top 10% of income earners has jumped 200% since 1995 while the bottom 40% have seen a decline.

					Wealth and income disparities are both apparent and significant along racial lines, with white households experiencing a 43% increase in net worth between 1995 and 2016 while Black household net worth remained flat.

					Attorney General William Barr on Thursday said U.S. technology companies including Apple and Google have been “all too willing” to collaborate with China’s Communist Party, as he tore into that country’s leaders in a fiery speech.

					Speaking at the Gerald Ford Presidential Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., Barr said that “over the years, corporations such as Google GOOG, -0.16% GOOGL, +0.12%, Microsoft MSFT, -0.51%, Yahoo and Apple AAPL, -0.20% have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP.”

					“There are clear signs that the longer-term damage is beginning to mount, with permanent layoffs beginning to climb, and the flow of workers from employment to unemployment still elevated,” Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. “Moreover, absent a vaccine, the need for ongoing physical distancing will prevent a full recovery.”

					These staggering unemployment numbers come as the U.S. struggles to contain the coronavirus outbreak, particularly in states like Florida, California, Texas and Arizona. Nearly 3.5 million cases have been confirmed in the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. 

					In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott joined a growing number of governors requiring that people wear masks in public. Florida is facing an ICU bed shortage and Arizona has set a record for hospital beds in use. California recently reversed some of its reopening measures amid another spike in Covid cases.
